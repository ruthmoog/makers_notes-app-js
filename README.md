# Notes app

This project is going to be a front-end simple page web app built only with JavaScript.
The test _framework_ is written in JS, and app functionality had been built with TDD.

### Approach

The app is built around three given user stories and a series of challenges. Code has been written through pair programming.

## User Stories

```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```

```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```

```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```

(NB: notes do not need to be permanently stored. If the user refreshes their web page, they'll lose their notes, and that's fine.)
